The backend is located at "./backend/"...
Files available are
	* all.php          - lists quiete everything (browser, os, bot, referer, search, country, counter, times)
	                     use var "list" for less
	* bots.php         - lists count of bot visits
	* br_os.php        - lists used Browser and Operation System in one file (same as os.php and browser.php together)
	* browser.php      - lists used Browsers, categorised by Browser Family
	* counter.php      - show the count for each day
	* country.php      - lists the countries from the visitors

Return is always an xml file and input options are set via url parameter (see above).
Root-element is always list, for more info look at the bottom of each script...

An Advanced option using the backend is to set the options via $fstat_backend_[name], set $is_include = true
and include the file (try to using ob_start, ob_get_contents, ob_end_clean ;) )
